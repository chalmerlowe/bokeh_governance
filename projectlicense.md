About the Copyright Holders

The bokeh Core Team is the collection of developers of the bokeh
project. This includes all of the bokeh sub-projects, including bokeh
itself.

Full credits for bokeh contributors can be found in the documentation.

Our Copyright Policy
====================

bokeh uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright
over their contributions to bokeh. However, it is important to note that
these contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus,
the bokeh source code, in its entirety, is not the copyright of any single
person or institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the
entire bokeh Core Team. If individual contributors want to maintain
a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on,
they should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change
when they commit the change to one of the bokeh repositories.

With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code
file to indicate the copyright and license terms:

	# Copyright (c) bokeh Core Team.
	# Distributed under the terms of the Simplified BSD License.

Other licenses can be found in the LICENSES directory of the main bokeh
repository http://github.com/pydata/bokeh.
