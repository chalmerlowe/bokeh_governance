# bokeh Project Governance

The purpose of this repository is to formalize the governance process that the
bokeh project (The Project) has used informally since its inception. These documents
clarify how decisions are made and how the various elements of our community
interact, including the relationship between open source collaborative
development and work that may be funded by for-profit or non-profit entities.
